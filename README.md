# Ce n'est pas le bon niveau

## Project Overview

In the ***Ce n'est pas le bon niveau*** project, we created an immersive escape game where players must solve puzzles to help a character escape from an elevator. The game features three distinct levels, with each one corresponding to a different floor of the elevator. To successfully advance through the game, players must find hidden clues within physical letters and elements in the game box, then apply logic to decode various clues and escape.

We integrated both physical and digital components by using the **M5 Atom** microcontroller, enhancing the overall player experience. This combination of hardware and software added depth to the gameplay and created an interactive environment that responded to playersâ€™ actions in real-time.

## My Contribution

As a **Programmer**, **Sound Designer**, and **Designer**, I worked alongside a talented team to bring this project to life. My responsibilities included programming the microcontroller, designing interactive elements, and creating the sound and visual assets used in the game. I also contributed to the development of physical components, such as the game box, and helped integrate the user interface for the interactive visuals.

### Technologies Used:
- **M5 Atom** (Microcontroller)
- **TouchDesigner** (Visual Design Software)
- **Arduino IDE** (Programming)

## Team Members
